/** @file
 *  THE NAMES THE CERTIFICATE PORTAL'S CLIENT-SIDE PKCS#11 MODULE MUST USE.
 *
 *  This header is a contract with a component in another repository:
 *  xdg-desktop-portal-certificate ships (will ship) a PKCS#11 module that
 *  presents the certificates a user has granted to an application as a token,
 *  and performs the private key operations by calling the Certificate portal
 *  rather than by touching a card. This backend reaches that module the only way
 *  WebKitGTK can be made to reach anything: a PKCS#11 URI resolved through
 *  p11-kit, as spike S2 established (docs/SPIKES.md).
 *
 *  So the two sides have to agree on the token's identity, and there is nowhere
 *  else to agree it: a URI is all that crosses. THESE STRINGS ARE THE INTERFACE.
 *  Changing one is changing an interface between two repositories.
 *
 *  WHY A TOKEN AND NOT A BROKERED SIGN. The Certificate portal's branch
 *  interface has no OpenPkcs11Endpoint, so a grant can only be used through
 *  brokered Sign - and neither WebKitGTK nor glib-networking has an
 *  external-signer seam a brokered Sign could be plugged into. A p11-kit module
 *  is the seam that does exist, because GnuTLS will load one and WebKit's
 *  network process will resolve a URI through it. See
 *  docs/decisions/0007-certificate-adapter.md.
 *
 *  WHAT THE MODULE MUST DO, stated here because this backend depends on it:
 *
 *   - present exactly one token whose CKA_LABEL is the label below, whose
 *     manufacturer and model are the strings below, so that a URI built from
 *     them names the portal and nothing else on the machine;
 *   - set CKF_PROTECTED_AUTHENTICATION_PATH on that token. The portal prompts
 *     in its own window; a backend must never be asked for the PIN, and this
 *     backend answers no PIN challenge on the portal adapter at all;
 *   - install its module configuration as the file named below, so that
 *     p11-kit's user and system module directories both work and a user can
 *     see and remove it;
 *   - expose the certificate object and the private key object under the same
 *     CKA_ID, so that swapping type=cert for type=private in the URI names the
 *     pair - which is exactly what this backend does.

# Adapted from the sibling backend xdg-desktop-portal-certificate's tools/lib.sh
# (same author, same licence), with the fixture marker, the .portal
# file and the routed interface changed.
#
# lib.sh -- the two things every script in tools/ was doing its own copy of:
# deciding a scratch directory is safe to write into and to DELETE, and building
# the throwaway XDG_DESKTOP_PORTAL_DIR the development frontend reads.
#
# Sourced, never executed.

# --------------------------------------------------------------- scratch dirs
#
# WHAT THESE DIRECTORIES HOLD, and why the checks are not paranoia: a SoftHSM
# fixture directory contains the PKCS#11 module a client certificate is resolved
# through and the PIN file the backend reads, and a portal directory decides
# which .portal files the frontend reads and which backend it therefore hands a
# sign-in to. Both are removed by these scripts.
#
# THE FIVE THINGS THAT ARE CHECKED, and each is here because ownership alone is
# not enough for a recursive delete:
#
#   1. NO SYMLINKS ON THE PATH. The path is compared against its own resolved
#      real path, so a fixture reached through a link -- which is how a
#      directory that passes every other check can still be somebody else's --
#      is refused rather than followed.
#   2. UNDER $TMPDIR, by real path, so a mistyped variable pointing at a home
#      directory or a source tree is refused rather than emptied.
#   3. EVERY ANCESTOR from $TMPDIR down is owned by this user or by root, and
#      is not writable by anyone else unless it is sticky -- which is exactly
#      what /tmp is. Without this a fixture can be correct and still be reached
#      through a directory a second user can rename underneath it.
#   4. A MARKER that is a REGULAR FILE, owned by this user, mode 0600, naming
#      the fixture that created it. A marker that is a symlink, or one another
#      user could have written, proves nothing.
#   5. MODE 0700 (or 0500) ON THE FIXTURE ITSELF, and it is REFUSED rather than
#      repaired. Every fixture here is created exclusively with umask 077, so
#      it is 0700 from its first instant; one that is not 0700 now was open at
#      some point, and a directory that was writable is a directory whose
#      marker may have been forged.
#
# A directory that does not exist is created exclusively -- mktemp -d for the
# throwaway ones, a plain mkdir (never mkdir -p, which is happy to adopt a
# directory somebody else has just made) for the one whose name two other
# scripts have to be able to predict. One that exists without a valid marker is
# never touched: the message says to remove it by hand, because a script
# guessing that an unmarked directory is disposable is exactly the accident the
# marker exists to prevent.
#
# $TMPDIR ITSELF IS THE OPERATOR'S CHOICE and is not validated beyond 3 above.
# Containment under it is a guard against a typo, not a trust boundary: a
# TMPDIR pointing somewhere unwise is a decision the person running these
# scripts made, and what the checks defend is the case where somebody ELSE
# controls part of the path.

# --------------------------------------------------- the dev XDG_DESKTOP_PORTAL_DIR
#
# THE WHOLE MACHINE'S PORTALS, PLUS OURS. Setting XDG_DESKTOP_PORTAL_DIR makes
# the frontend ignore EVERY other .portal directory and EVERY other portals.conf
# on the machine (desktop-portal/xdp-portal-config.c: both lookups `goto out` /
# return as soon as the variable is set). A directory holding only
# certificate.portal therefore does not mean "our backend plus the usual ones";
# it means our backend and NOTHING ELSE -- no file chooser, no screenshot, and
# no SETTINGS.
#
# That was a real bug and it had two visible faces:
#
#   * the sign-in window came up in the light theme on a dark desktop, because
#     org.freedesktop.portal.Settings had no backend to answer
#     org.freedesktop.appearance/color-scheme from; and
#   * in --live mode the stack took org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop on the REAL
#     session bus with that configuration, so for as long as it ran EVERY
#     portal on the session was gone, not just replaced.
#
# So the directory is populated with a symlink to every .portal the machine has,
# and the portals.conf is the machine's EFFECTIVE configuration flattened into
# one file, with one line replaced for this backend.

# configuration that names the interface, or that has a `default`, decides it,
# and a `none` anywhere in that configuration's list for the interface means no
# backend at all. So copying the first file loses whatever a later one said --
# a partial ~/.config file hiding /etc's `Screenshot=none`, for instance.
